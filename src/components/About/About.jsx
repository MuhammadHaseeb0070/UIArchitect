          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Greetings, I am Muhammad Haseeb, an enthusiastic student web
            developer currently dedicated to pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science in Pakistan. My fulfillment lies in the creation of
            purposeful and effective web solutions. The trajectory of my journey
            in the realm of web development has culminated in the conception of
            this website.

          <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            The inspiration behind this project came from a desire to simplify
            the web development process. Recognizing that many developers prefer
            to avoid the complexities of frameworks like Bootstrap, I envisioned
            a platform where individuals could effortlessly discover and
            implement their favorite web components without the overhead.
